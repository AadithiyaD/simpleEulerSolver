# README

Euler solver written from cfd.university First CFD solver ebook. I've also made some extra extensions to the code

The point of this repo is to be my first real attempt at developing a solver, and to improve my understanding of
the numerics involved

Run the exe from the project root; The write out directive assumes this.
