# README

Euler solver for an incompressible shock problem. Written from cfd.university First CFD solver ebook, with some extra extensions to the code made by me.


The point of this repo is to be my first real attempt at developing a solver, and to improve my understanding of
the numerics involved

Run the exe from the project root; The write out directive assumes this.
