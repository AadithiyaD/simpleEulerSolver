# Todo

- New flux limiters
- Different reconstsruction schemes?
- Comparisons b/w diff flux scheme in plotter
- 2D case
    - Cavity flow?
- excercise => do a version by replacing array with vector and see how much diff in comp speed
- Cache the sodshock in plotter.py

things I could try implementing:

- Method of Manufactured solutions to verify code
- New flux limiters
- New reconstructions schemes
- Turbulence model(?)
- post processing python script
- Different riemann solvers?
